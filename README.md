# Turtle

Turtle is a **toy** "programming language" made for educational purposes. Turtle should not be used for anything more than just playing around.

# Turtle Language

To see the features of the turtle **language**, navigate to the [/lang/](https://github.com/nocturnodev/turtle/tree/main/lang) folder.

# Physical Turtle

The twist to Turtle is the ability to generate Turtle language cards (like the old punch cards (but without the *punch* factor)) and then scan them to generate code. To generate, navigate to the [/physical/generate/](https://github.com/nocturnodev/turtle/tree/main/physical/generate) folder and to scan, navigate to the [/physical/scan/](https://github.com/nocturnodev/turtle/tree/main/physical/scan) folder.
