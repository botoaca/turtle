# Physical Turtle: Card Generation

To generate a Turtle card, you can use the following command:
`python src/main.py -in input/test.turt -u "Placeholde R." -i "P.L.H"` where `-in input/test.turt` is your file path of the Turtle code file, `-u "Placeholde R."` is your name and `-i "P.L.H"` is your institute.

The script will generate a Turtle card in the `/output/` folder.
