# Physical Turtle: Card Scanning

To generate a Turtle card, you can use the following command:
`python src/main.py -in input/test.turt.png` where `-in input/test.turt` is your file path of the Turtle card image.

The script will generate a Turtle code file in the `/output/` folder and an upscaled, inverted and cropped version of your input image that was used to detect the text in the `/process/` folder.
